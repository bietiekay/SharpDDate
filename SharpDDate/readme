The Discordian or Erisian calendar is an alternative calendar used by some adherents of Discordianism. It is 
specified on page 00034 of the Principia Discordia.

The Discordian year 1 YOLD is 1166 BC. (Elsewhere in the Principia Discordia, it is mentioned that the Curse of 
Greyface occurred in 1166 BC, so this is presumably the start-date of the calendar.) As a reference, 2010 AD 
is 3176 YOLD (Year of Our Lady of Discord). While the abbreviation "YOLD" isn't used in the Principia, and the 
phrase "Year of Our Lady of Discord" is only mentioned once, it is a Discordian tradition to use that 
designation.
